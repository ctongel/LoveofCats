        <p> Settling Into a New Home <br><br> It is important to remember that cats are more shy than dogs. Giving your new cat its own room to get acclimated in is crucial in forming a connection. Rooms such as bathrooms, offices, or some closets are prime examples of such areas. This allows for the cat to get used to the new smells and surroundings without the added stress of humans around. This room should have all your cats essential items (food,water, litter, toys) so it feels more 'home' like to them. Depending on your cats temperment they may warm up quickly, or may need more time to adjust. However, it is crucial to remember not to force this friendship. Slowly introducing yourself to shyer cats allows them to approach you on their terms which makes them feel more confident. <br><br> As your cat begins to feel more confident you can let it out of the room and into the house. This may shock them at first as there's more activity in these rooms, but allowing them to explore on their own is helpful in building its confidence. It is still important to allow your cat to call the shots with you in these stages. Allowing them to feel in control of interacting with you is important. If you start forcing interaction too early on it may make your cat skittish or seemingly hostile due to stress.

        <h1>Behavior 101 <br>
            <div id="behave">Cats are seemingly mysterious animals in the way they communicate. However, if you look closely you'll see that your cat is actually telling you al lot. It is a little known fact that cats learned to meow to communicate with humans better. The meows, chrips, purrs, and hisses tell a lot about your cats mood. Now add in body language, and you've got an expressive animal in front of you. <br><br> The fastest way to read a cat is based off their ears. Front facing ears express interest while backwards ears express distress and a warning. Another way many people read a cat is based off their tail. A high raised tail means they are content and they can be approached. However a lowered, thrashing tail idicates a warning to keep your distance. <br> <br> Another important factor is the cats fur. Cats are prideful in their appearance and rarely have unkept fur. Matted fur can indicate a sick cat that should be treated quickly. However, a fluffed up cat is a sign of aggression. Cats use their fur to look larger to their predators in an attempt to ward them off.  </div></h1>
